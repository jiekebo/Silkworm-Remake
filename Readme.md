# Silkworm remake

My attempt at creating a remake of one of my all time favorite Amiga games; [Silkworm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkworm_%28video_game%29).
The project is in a dilapidated state, since I have not had time to continue working on it.
Currently the sprite engine supports layers, which can contain several sprites. These
sprites can be static, animated at a set frame-rate, and be controllable. The sprites implement
hit boxes for collision detection, which has not yet been implemented.
My plan was also to implement parallax scrolling for background imagery, using several layers for
a nice effect, while keeping true to the original jewel the game is.
The old graphics were ripped from the original Amiga game using an ADF-disk image and a tool
called [GFX Ripper](http://retrospec.sgn.net/game/gfxrip).
